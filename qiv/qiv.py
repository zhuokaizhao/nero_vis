"""
This is a wrapper around "_qiv" the CFFI-generated extension
module for accessing the C shared library libqiv.{so,dylib}
The objects "exported" by this module are:
- wrappers for functions that use biff, turning biff error messages into Exceptions
- Tenums for making airEnums in libqiv useful from Python
- lib = _qiv.lib: direct references to the CFFI-generated objects
- ffi = _qiv.ffi: The value of this ffi over "from cffi import FFI; ffi = FFI()"
  is that it knows about the typedefs (especially for "real") that were cdef()'d to
  build the CFFI wrapper, which (via ffi.new) can help set up calls into libqiv.
For more about CFFI see https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
(NOTE: GLK welcomes suggestions on how to make this more useful or pythonic)
